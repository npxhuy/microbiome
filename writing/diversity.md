# 27-3 May's questions
1. What is species richness? How does species diversity differ from species richness? 
> Species richness is the total number of different species present in a particular area or ecosystem. \
Species diversity is not only the number of different species present but also the relative abundance of each species and the distribution of species within a particular area. \
Species diversity providing a more complete picture of the biodiversity of a particular ecosystem.
2. Broadly, what does alpha diversity tell you? 
> Alpha diversity measures the diversity of species within a specific location or sample
> Provides information about the richness and evenness of species within an ecosystem
3. What is the difference between alpha and beta diversity? 
>  Beta diversity measures the differences in species composition and diversity between two or more habitats or ecosystems. \
Thus, in this case, beta diversity measures the diversity between samples, while alpha measures the diversity within sample.
4. Based on Jones et al. 2019 or even just your own guesses/hypotheses, what are some reasons why microbiome *diversity* might differ between insects eating different plants? 
> The diet composition (hosting on different plant) + environmental factors (since they thrive in different location) + genetically different
5. What do you think will be the major determinants of microbial diversity in our flies? host plant? population? east vs. west of the baltic? north vs. south? something else? why? relate your prediction to the results from Jones et al. 2019. 
> It's hard to predict right now because I think they all have equal chance to be the major determinants of microbial diversity.
> But if I have to guess, I would think south will be the major determinants of microbial diveristy? Why? I think because it's warmer
6. For our meeting next week, make a list of at least five questions or things you found confusing about these two readings.
